## get started

1. open https://quantlib.js.org with morden web browser, like chrome, firefox, etc...

2. select a `spec` or `example` from menu. `spec` source will be displayed on left panel, `spec` will be run with [jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) by your web browser, and test result will be displayed on right panel

## docs
* https://quantlib.js.org/docs
* official c++ quantlib doc: https://www.quantlib.org/reference/

## usage

this library is still at early stage, many test cases fails, it's for enthusiast only.

A static [report](https://quantlib.js.org/test-suite/) is updated regularly, so you could see the overall test pass rate.

this project assumes `user` is already familiar with the `c++` [QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib)

### install

#### jsdelivr
* latest version: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quantlib/ql@latest/ql.mjs
* version `x.y.z` : https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quantlib/ql@x.y.z/ql.mjs

#### unpkg
* latest version: https://unpkg.com/@quantlib/ql@latest/ql.mjs
* version `x.y.z` : https://unpkg.com/@quantlib/ql@x.y.z/ql.mjs

#### npm registry

##### official:

```
npm install @quantlib/ql
```

##### github:

```
npm install @quantlibjs/ql
```

#### web browser

`ql.mjs` is [ESM format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), when using in html script tag, make sure to have script type set to "module"

```html
<script type="module">
    import {someclass} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@quantlib/ql@latest/ql.mjs'
    const obj=new someclass();
    obj.dosomething();
</script>
```

#### node.js
`quantlib.js` works in `node.js` environment. after installing with `npm`, pass `--experimental-modules` to `node` to use ESM javascript file

```sh
node --experimental-modules test.mjs
```

in `test.mjs`
```js
import {someclass} from '@quantlib/ql'
const obj=new someclass();
obj.dosomething();
```

#### typescript
`ql.d.ts` is published along with `ql.mjs`

```ts
import {someclass} from '@quantlib/ql'
const obj:someclass = new someclass();
obj.dosomething();
```

## test-suite & example

source code:
* https://github.com/quantlibjs/test-suite
* https://github.com/quantlibjs/examples

they were converted to `javascript` from the `c++` [quantlib](https://www.quantlib.org/) [test-suite](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/tree/master/test-suite) & [Examples](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/tree/master/Examples)

these are the code loaded and executed in https://quantlib.js.org
